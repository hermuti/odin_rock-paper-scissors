# odin_rock-paper-scissors
a simple game played on the console to develop javascript code skill

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The Odin Project provides open-source curriculum for web development students. By working on this project, I gained experience working within an established codebase while practicing real-world development and testing workflows.

## 🔍 QA Focus Areas

### Testing Complex User Interactions
- Decision Logic Testing: Verified game rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock)
- User Input Validation: Tested various input methods and edge cases
- State Management: Ensured consistent game state throughout user sessions
- UI/UX Validation: Confirmed intuitive gameplay and clear feedback mechanisms

### Development Skills Demonstrated
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Algorithm implementation for game logic
- Code readability and maintainability
- Version control collaboration practices

## 🚀 Key Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Real-time user vs computer matches
- Score Tracking: Persistent scoring across multiple rounds
- Responsive Design: Cross-device compatibility
- Clear Visual Feedback: Immediate results at the end of 5 rounds

## 🛠 Technologies

- HTML5 Semantics
- CSS3 Flexbox/Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

This project enhanced my understanding of:
- Testing interactive web applications
- Validating game logic and user flows
- Identifying edge cases in user interactions
